The dRuby Book has been completely updated and expanded from its Japanese version, with three new chapters written by Masatoshi-san. You’ll find out about the design concepts of the dRuby library, and walk through step-by-step tutorial examples. By building various distributed applications, you’ll master distributed programming as well as advanced Ruby techniques such as multithreading, object references, garbage collection, and security. Then you’ll graduate to advanced techniques for using dRuby with Masatoshi-san’s other libraries, such as eRuby and Rinda – the Ruby version of the Linda distributed tuplespace system. In the three new chapters, you’ll see how to integrate dRuby and eRuby, get a thorough grounding in parallel programming concepts with Rinda, and create a full text search system using Drip.

This book shows you how to advance the NXT with more than 45 exciting projects that include creating a cool magic wand that writes words in thin air, building a remotely guided vehicle, and constructing sophisticated robots that can sense color, light, temperature, and more. All projects are explained with easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions, so you’ll be able to create them successfully whether you’re a novice or an expert. This book also shows you how to expand the programming software and use the alternative language NXC.
New input devices?such as keypads, sensors, and even the human body?are covered, along with fun games such as surfing, PONG, and SIMON. On the serious side, there are classic engineering challenges such as controlling an inverted pendulum, making a robot that follows a wall, and building several light-seeking vehicles. Some projects are just entertaining, such as the Etch-A-NXT; others are useful, such as a motorized camera mount that takes panoramic photographs.
This second edition accounts for the important changes found in the next generation NXT, and it also covers the original concepts in greater depth. Details are presented for practically unlimited expansion of the NXT inputs and outputs by using the I2C communications bus, and several power amplifier designs allow the NXT outputs to drive bigger motors. Instructions are also included for adapting LEGO Power Functions motors to work directly with the NXT.

It’s a no, non-sense guide with case studies of increasing complexity throughout the book. This book is written by Felipe Gutierrez, a Spring expert consultant who works with Pivotal, the company behind the popular Spring Framework.
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can almost “just run”. The goal is to allow you to get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration. Spring Boot provides a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development and provides a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration); and with absolutely no code generation nor requirements for XML configurations.
After you read and use this book, you’ll be able to more quickly and most productively develop complex Spring applications and even microservices – out of the box – with minimal fuss on things like configurations. This book will let you fully leverage the Spring Boot productivity suite of tools and how to apply them through the use of a few case studies as well.

CORS in Action introduces CORS from both the server and the client perspective. It starts with making and enabling CORS requests and then explores performance, debugging, and security. You’ll learn to build apps that can take advantage of APIs hosted anywhere and how to write APIs that expand your products to a wider range of users.

CSS3’s latest additions allow designers to craft fully responsive, sophisticated layouts without the need for complex scripts or smoke-and-mirror workarounds.
CSS3 is still in active development, with browser vendors racing against each other to implement the latest recommendations from the W3C. Pro CSS3 Layout Techniques will help you cut through the waffle and get straight to the heart of what works now, while showing you how to be ready for the future of CSS!

Whether you’re getting to grips with C# for the first time or working to deepen your understanding, you’ll find this book to be a clear and refreshing take on each aspect of the language.
Figures are of prime importance in this book. While teaching programming seminars, Daniel Solis found that he could almost watch the light bulbs going on over the students’ heads as he drew the figures on the whiteboard. In this text, he has distilled each important concept into simple but accurate illustrations. For this latest edition, Dan is joined by fellow experienced teacher and programmer, Cal Schrotenboer, to bring you the very latest C# language features, along with an understanding of the frameworks it most often lives in: .NET and the new .NET Core.
For something as intricate and precise as a programming language, there must be text as well as figures. But rather than long, wordy explanations, the authors use short, concise descriptions and bullet lists to make each important piece of information visually distinct and memorable.

This book can be read as a standalone (you don’t need to have read the previous books in the series, although it may help) and focuses on: scoring system and lives (e.g., keeping track of the score across the game), user interface (menus and in-game information for 2D games), character movement (e.g., walk, run, jump, crouch, etc.), character interaction (i.e., collect objects or avoid other objects), playful game-mechanics (e.g., bouncing objects, moving platforms, time-limited level, collapsing bridges, etc.) and improving C# programing skills (e.g., important and useful functions and principles that you can reuse in your own games).
The main idea behind this book is to save you some headaches when you need to create your 2D platformer and to help you to find the time to actually code your game, by explaining simple and effective ways and best coding practices that you can use easily to create more code (and games) in less time with less stress and more fun.

The building of single-page applications is a web-designer-friendly process with the AngularJS expressive HTML vocabulary. It drastically reduces the amount of JavaScript required to control complex user interactions and enforces a modular approach to structuring your JavaScript code.
This book covers all of the stages of building a single-page web application, starting with frontend components powered by AngularJS, continuing with web services that leverage ServiceStack, and putting it all together in an ASP.NET MVC application. You will learn a development process focused on rapid delivery and testability for all application layers.
What you will learn from this book * Create a standalone AngularJS application to prototype user interfaces * Validate complex forms with AngularJS and use Bootstrap to style them * Build RESTful web services that work well with single-page applications * Implement automatic validation for web service requests to reduce your boilerplate code * Use web services with AngularJS to offload and secure your application logic * Test your AngularJS and web service code to improve the quality of your software deliverables * Structure your JavaScript code and organize your files so your application can grow at a sustainable pace
Approach This is a step-by-step, example-driven guide that uses a gradual introduction of concepts; most of the chapters also contain an annotated exploration of how to build a specific part of a production-ready application.
Who this book is written for If you are a .NET developer that has already built web applications or web services with a fundamental knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and want to explore single-page applications, then this book will give you a great start. The frameworks, tools, and libraries mentioned here will make you productive and minimize the friction usually associated with building server-side web applications.

It allows developers to create games that are bigger and more dynamic, giving the games a higher level of replayability. Procedural generation isn’t just one technique, it’s a collection of techniques and approaches that are used together to create dynamic systems and objects. C++ is the industry-standard programming language to write computer games. It’s at the heart of most engines, and is incredibly powerful. SFML is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, and open-source multimedia library. Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.
Using C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.
Throughout the course of this book, we’ll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We’ll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.

It makes asynchronous programming cleaner, intuitive, and robust. Discover how to use the RxJS library to write programs in a simpler way, unifying asynchronous mechanisms such as callbacks and promises into a single, powerful construct. Learn to think about your programs as streams of data that you can transform by expressing what should happen, instead of having to painstakingly program how it should happen. You’ll be able to handle real-world concurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease.
Create highly concurrent applications while writing simpler code using the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS), a set of libraries for event composition. Programming real-world applications in JavaScript involves lots of asynchronous events–you might end up spending more time coordinating asynchronous code in your program than writing its actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools from reactive programming that will help you write cleaner and more robust asynchronous programs.
Find out about Observable sequences, a unifying data type to write highly concurrent code. Discover Schedulers and change the concept of time in your applications, making asynchronous testing sane again. Along the way you’ll see real-world examples for the browser and Node.js, including a real-time earthquake visualization in 20 lines of code and a frantic shoot-‘em-up space videogame. You’ll also use Cycle.js – a modern, fully reactive web framework – to make a whole new breed of web applications.
By the end of the book, you’ll know how to apply reactive programming to solve complex problems, build efficient programs with reactive user interfaces, and write your code more declaratively.

To start with, we will discuss the details of the Android process model and the Java low-level concurrent framework, delivered by the Android SDK. Next, we will discuss the creation of IntentServices, bound services, and external services, which can run in the background even when the user is not interacting with them. In a more advanced phase, you will create background tasks that are able to execute CPU-intensive tasks in native code–making use of the Android NDK.
You will be then guided through the process of interacting with remote services asynchronously using the HTTP protocol or Google GCM Platform. Finally, we will introduce RxJava, a popular asynchronous Java framework used to compose work in a concise and reactive way.

“I was amazed at how much information was packed into this book.”
“As a developer with almost 10 years of MySQL experience, I still picked up a lot of new detail on things I thought I knew.”
“I found this to be a great introductory book to MySQL.”
“Has already proven to be helpful in solving several challenges I’ve encountered on my current MySQL project.”
That’s a sampling of what developers said about the 1st Edition of Murach’s MySQL.
Now, this 2nd Edition has been updated and improved throughout. As a result, it’s easier than ever to use for learning MySQL from scratch, for switching to MySQL from another flavor of SQL (like MS SQL Server or Oracle), or for quickly looking up the forgotten details that are so essential as you develop database applications.
Section 1 introduces you to relational databases and SQL, shows you how to use the graphical MySQL Workbench to work with a MySQL database, and teaches you to code SQL queries to retrieve, add, update, and delete data in a MySQL database. Section 2 goes deeper into querying, showing you how to work with summary queries, subqueries, data types, and functions. Section 3 shows you how to design a MySQL database using an EER model, implement the design, and create views. Section 4 shows how to create stored procedures that provide functionality similar to procedural programming languages like PHP, Java, C++, C#, and VB. And Section 5 introduces you to database administration tasks like securing and backing up database data.
Whether you start from the beginning or jump in anywhere, it’s a great guide for MySQL users at any level.

In today’s connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become synonymous with APIs.
The depth, breadth, and ease of use of Spring makes it one of the most attractive frameworks in the Java ecosystem. Marrying the two technologies is therefore a very natural choice.
This book takes you through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the Spring Framework to implement these services. Starting from the basics of the philosophy behind REST, you’ll go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that you can apply to your own circumstances.
This book goes beyond the use of Spring and explores approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. You’ll learn techniques to deal with security in Spring and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies.
Finally, the book ends by walking you through building a Java client for your RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques for it.
Who This Book Is For
This book is intended for those who want to learn to build RESTful web services with the Spring Framework. To make best use of the code samples included in the book, you should have a basic knowledge of the Java language. Previous experience with the Spring Framework would also help you get up and running quickly.

It provides a productive development environment, allowing you to just hit the “refresh” button in your browser to compile your changes and reload the application. Because of its stateless nature, the framework makes it easy to build applications that scale. Play provides a reactive programming model to harness the event-driven HTTP layer.
This book provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to build a complete web application following best application development practices using Play framework 2. All aspects specific to web-oriented architectures are covered: the HTTP layer, JSON manipulation, HTML templating, asset compression and concatenation, form submission, content negotiation, security, and HTTP streaming. The book will also provide detailed architectural insights into Play framework to give you a better understanding in order to successfully build scalable applications.

Designing and implementing applications in a modular manner is highly encouraged and desirable in both simple and enterprise level applications.
This book covers some real-life examples of modules and how we can translate that into our world of programming and application design. After getting an overview of JavaScript object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and their practical usage, you should be able to write your own object definitions using the module pattern. You will then learn to design and augment modules and will explore the concepts of cloning, inheritance, sub-modules, and code extensibility. You will also learn about SandBoxing, application design, and architecture based on modular design concepts. Become familiar with AMD and CommonJS utilities.
By the end of the book, you will be able to build spectacular modular applications in JavaScript.

This book is an update from version 4.0 to version 4.5. It covers the detailed penetration testing techniques for different specializations like wireless networks, VOIP systems, and the cloud.
Metasploit Penetration Testing Cookbook, Second Edition covers a number of topics which were not part of the first edition. You will learn how to penetrate an operating system (Windows 8 penetration testing) to the penetration of a wireless network, VoIP network, and then to cloud.
The book starts with the basics, such as gathering information about your target, and then develops to cover advanced topics like building your own framework scripts and modules. The book goes deep into operating-systems-based penetration testing techniques and moves ahead with client-based exploitation methodologies. In the post-exploitation phase, it covers meterpreter, antivirus bypass, ruby wonders, exploit building, porting exploits to the framework, and penetration testing, while dealing with VOIP, wireless networks, and cloud computing.

Imagine an app that describes to the visually impaired the objects around them, or reads the Sunday paper, a favorite magazine, or a street sign. Or an app that is capable of monitoring what is happening inside an area without human control, and then makes a decision based on interpreting an occurrence detected with a live camera. This book teaches developers Microsoft’s Computer Vision APIs, a service capable of understanding and interpreting the content of any image.
Author Del Sole begins by providing a succinct “need to know” overview of the service with descriptions. You then learn from hands-on demonstrations that show how basic C# code examples can be re-used across platforms. From there you will be guided through two different kinds of applications that interact with the service in two different ways: the more common means of calling a REST service to get back JSON data, and via the .NET libraries that Microsoft has been building to simplify the job (this latter one with Xamarin).

TypeScript is an innovative open source language from Microsoft that combines powerful language features and enhanced tooling support with the key attractions of JavaScript as a flexible, dynamic language that can run in any browser and on any operating system. Pro TypeScript tells you everything you need to know about this exciting new language and how to use it in your applications.
Starting with an introduction to the language and its features, the book takes you through some of the major features of TypeScript in depth, from working with the type system through object-orientation to understanding the runtime and the TypeScript compiler. The book then covers some of the factors you need to consider when running a TypeScript application in the browser, including interacting with the DOM, making asynchronous requests, and working with useful browser APIs, followed by a demonstration of server-side TypeScript using the popular Node.js framework.
Because TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript, exception handling, memory management and garbage collection can differ depending on where you run your program, so these topics get a chapter to themselves. You’ll also find out how to include popular JavaScript frameworks in your applications, so you can combine the benefits of TypeScript with some of the best JavaScript code that’s already out there waiting to be used. The final chapter gives an overview of automated testing for TypeScript applications.
Pro TypeScript offers a balanced and practical guide to a language that will transform your experience of JavaScript development.

Emphasis is placed on creating tests that, while automated, are easily adapted as the software under construction evolves toward its final form. Techniques in the book are arranged into five categories: scripting, testing, the environment, running and logging of tests, and reviewing of the results. Every automation engineer sooner or later will face similar issues to the ones covered in these categories, and you will benefit from the simple and clear answers provided in this book. While the focus of the book is on the use of automated tools, the tips are not specific to any one vendor solution. The tips cover general issues that are faced no matter the specific tool, and are broadly applicable, often even to manual testing efforts.

Recent advances in computer technology have led to a new generation of VR devices such as VR headsets. Accordingly, virtual reality poses many new scientific challenges for researchers and professionals.
The aim of this book, a manual meant for both designers and users of virtual reality, is to present the current state of knowledge on the use of VR headsets in the most complete way possible. The book is divided into 13 chapters. The objective of the first chapter is to give an introduction to VR and clarify its scope. The next chapter presents a theoretical approach to virtual reality through our Immersion and Interaction methodology also known as “3I² model’’. Then, a chapter about human senses is necessary to understand the sensorimotor immersion, especially vision. These chapters are followed by several chapters which present the different visual interfaces and the VR headsets currently available on the market. These devices can impart comfort and health problems due to sensorimotor discrepancies. A chapter is devoted to these problems, followed by a chapter that gives a detailed discussion of methods and 32 solutions to dispel, or at least to decrease, VR sickness. The following three chapters present different VR applications that use VR headsets (behavioural sciences, industrial uses and Digital Art) and the final chapter provides conclusions and discusses future VR challenges.

Why is this open-source tool so popular? Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you. Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.
“”Hibernate in Action”” carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching. The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day-they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.

This book won’t help you push your deadline back, but it will help you get the job done in less time.
Above all, Ruby in Practice is a practical book for developers who want an in depth understanding of the Ruby language and its toolset. The book is divided into three major parts.
The first part concentrates on issues that developers face both from within their organizations and from their peers. The authors weigh the costs and benefits of using Ruby in enterprise development projects, the over-riding theme being that every developer should always aim to use the right tool for any particular job. The authors then examine the pros and cons of developing with Ruby, and where appropriate, compare Ruby to other languages, both conceptually and in code.
The second part discusses techniques for communication and integration of systems. The authors describe how libraries and techniques are used to facilitate messaging, web development and communication automation. They also focus on how the strategies in the first section can be used with these libraries to make development more flexible and efficient.
The last part shows how to manage data and integrate with existing data using Ruby. The authors describe techniques for using existing Ruby libraries that either replace popular Java libraries or can interface with existing data in a different way. They go on to show you how strategies covered in the first section can be used to enable Ruby to interact with existing assets or to build new data systems.

Web Sockets, asynchronous input and output with Servlets, and strong type safety through the CDI containers will ensure that Java EE 7 remains popular for server-side applications.
If you are a user aiming to get acquainted with the Java EE 7 platform, this book is for you.
“Java EE 7 Handbook” provides a solid foundation of knowledge for developers to build business applications. Following the lead of Agile practices, there is a focus on writing tests to demonstrate test-driven development principles, using the embedded GlassFish 4.0 container examples and the Gradle build system. You will learn about CDI, EJB, JPA, JMS, MDB, Servlets, WebSocket, JAX-RS, Bean Validation, and so much more.
“Java EE 7 Handbook” is designed as a companion to the professional software developer who quickly needs to lookup some working code, understand the basics of the framework, and then go out and fulfill the business contract with the customer. Typically, engineers are under pressure to develop professional code that is of high quality and contains a low number of bugs. Java EE 7 Handbook relies heavily on the Arquillian framework to illustrate how much easier it is to write Java EE tests, and together with the modern practice of writing containerless applications that actually embed an application container, developing agile Java EE suddenly becomes reasonable, smart, pragmatic, and achievable.

Starting with the basics of Android development, we move on to more advanced concepts, and we’ll guide you through common tasks developers struggle to solve. The first few chapters cover the basics including Activities, Layouts, Widgets, and the Menu. From there, we cover fragments and data storage (including SQLite), device sensors, the camera, and GPS. Then we move on more advanced topics such as graphics and animation (including OpenGL), multi-threading with AsyncTask, and Internet functionality with Volley. We’ll also demonstrate Google Maps and Google Cloud Messaging (also known as Push Notifications) using the Google API Library.
Finally, we’ll take a look at several online services designed especially for Android development. Take your application big-time with full Internet web services without having to become a server admin by leveraging the power of Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers.

At their best, patterns are a shorthand method of communicating better ways to code (writing less, more maintainable, and more efficient code).
This book starts with Haskell 98 and through the lens of patterns and idioms investigates the key advances and programming styles that together make “modern Haskell”. Your journey begins with the three pillars of Haskell. Then you’ll experience the problem with Lazy I/O, together with a solution. You’ll also trace the hierarchy formed by Functor, Applicative, Arrow, and Monad. Next you’ll explore how Fold and Map are generalized by Foldable and Traversable, which in turn is unified in a broader context by functional Lenses. You’ll delve more deeply into the Type system, which will prepare you for an overview of Generic programming. In conclusion you go to the edge of Haskell by investigating the Kind system and how this relates to Dependently-typed programming.

The console features an exclusive Ouya store for applications and games designed specifically for the Ouya platform. It runs a modified version of Android 4.1 Jellybean, and is open to rooting without voiding the warranty. All systems can be used as development kits which allow any Ouya owner to be a developer without any licensing fee. Ouya Unity Game Development offers detailed, easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions which will help you learn the ins and outs of Ouya development in Unity.
From connecting your device with Android Debug Bridge to publishing it on the Ouya Developer Portal, this book will explain the processes involved in creating a game from scratch. As you progress through the book, you will learn about scenes, prefabs, sounds, models, and animations. By the end of the seventh chapter, you will have a 3D game with multiple levels, the possibility of in-app purchases, and controller support that runs on both the Ouya and an Android phone.
Starting with an introduction to Ouya, you will learn how to set up an environment and render game levels on Ouya. You will learn how to change levels and how to save the current level. You will then dive into Ouya controller integration and character animation. This book will also teach you the workings of audio source components, and will show you how to add textures to prefabs. Finally, you will learn how you can monetize the game. By the end of this book, you will have the game running on Ouya and geared up to create games on your own.

It is especially well suited to stacking abstractions high with a relatively low performance cost. This book addresses the challenges of writing efficient code with lazy evaluation and techniques often used to optimize the performance of Haskell programs.
We open with an in-depth look at the evaluation of Haskell expressions and discuss optimization and benchmarking. You will learn to use parallelism and we’ll explore the concept of streaming. We’ll demonstrate the benefits of running multithreaded and concurrent applications. Next we’ll guide you through various profiling tools that will help you identify performance issues in your program. We’ll end our journey by looking at GPGPU, Cloud and Functional Reactive Programming in Haskell. At the very end there is a catalogue of robust library recommendations with code samples.

You will learn to write server-side as well as client-side code that makes use of proven practices and patterns.
SOLID is an acronym popularized by Robert Martin used to describe five basic principles of good object-oriented design–Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion.   This book covers all five principles and illustrates how they can be used in ASP.NET Core 1.0 applications.
Design Patterns are time proven solutions to commonly occurring software design problems. The most well-known catalog of design patterns comes from Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, the so-called as GoF patterns (Gang of Four patterns). This book contains detailed descriptions of how to apply Creational, Structural and Behavioral GoF design patterns along with some Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. Popular JavaScript patterns are covered, along with working examples of all these patterns in ASP.NET Core 1.0 and C# are included.

It contains detailed explanations of the new Core MVC functionality which enables developers to produce leaner, cloud optimized and mobile-ready applications for the .NET platform. This book puts ASP.NET Core MVC into context and dives deep into the tools and techniques required to build modern, cloud optimized extensible web applications. All the new MVC features are described in detail and the author explains how best to apply them to both new and existing projects.
The ASP.NET Core MVC Framework is the latest evolution of Microsoft’s ASP.NET web platform, built on a completely new foundation. It represents a fundamental change to how Microsoft constructs and deploys web frameworks and is free of the legacy of earlier technologies such as Web Forms. ASP.NET Core MVC provides a “host agnostic” framework and a high-productivity programming model that promotes cleaner code architecture, test-driven development, and powerful extensibility.
Best-selling author Adam Freeman has thoroughly revised this market-leading book and explains how to get the most from ASP.NET Core MVC. He starts with the nuts-and-bolts and shows you everything through to advanced features, going in-depth to give you the knowledge you need.
This book follows the same format and style as the popular previous editions but brings everything up to date for the new ASP.NET Core MVC release. It presents a fully worked case study of a functioning ASP.NET MVC application that readers can use as a template for their own projects.
What You Will Learn:
Who This Book Is For:
This book is for web developers with a basic knowledge of ASP.NET and C# who want to incorporate the latest improvements and functionality in the new ASP.NET Core MVC Framework.

This is, in part, due to the lack of literature on the subject matter compared to the massive archives of technical design patterns. It is also due, in part, to the fact that it is human nature to use patterns in a similar manner to stencils – tracing the outlines without understanding the edges; every curve, line, twist, and turn in the shapes being drawn. In practice, patterns are often used interchangeably with specific features, copied as-is from one of the popular design pattern and wireframe libraries – see a full list in UXPin’s Guide to Wireframing.
Because I believe understanding patterns is fundamental to good product design and development, I’ve shared an abundance of these best practices with you to help you as you brainstorm, sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype.

Black,2009,520,English,11.1 MB,PDF,Ruby,,"The Well-Grounded Rubyist takes you from interested novice to proficient practitioner. It’s a beautifully written tutorial that begins with the basic steps to get your first Ruby program up and running and goes on to explore sophisticated topics like callable objects, reflection, and threading. Whether the topic is simple or tough, the book’s easy-to-follow examples and explanations will give you immediate confidence as you build your Ruby programming skills. The Well-Grounded Rubyist is a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the best-selling Ruby for Rails. In this new book, expert author David A. Black moves beyond Rails and presents a broader view of Ruby. It covers Ruby 1.9, and keeps the same sharp focus and clear writing that made Ruby for Rails stand out. Starting with the basics, The Well-Grounded Rubyist explains Ruby objects and their interactions from the ground up. In the middle chapters, the book turns to an examination of Ruby’s built-in, core classes, showing the reader how to manipulate strings, numbers, arrays, ranges, hashes, sets, and more. Regular expressions get attention, as do file and other I/O operations. Along the way, the reader is introduced to numerous tools included in the standard Ruby distribution–tools like the task manager Rake and the interactive Ruby console-based interpreter Irb–that facilitate Ruby development and make it an integrated and pleasant experience. The book encompasses advanced topics, like the design of Ruby’s class and module system, and the use of Ruby threads, taking even the new Rubyist deep into the language and giving every reader the foundations necessary to use, explore, and enjoy this unusually popular and versatile language. It’s no wonder one reader commented: “The technical depth is just right to not distract beginners, yet detailed enough for more advanced readers.”

Horstmann,2016,384,English,15.5 MB,PDF,Java,,"Interest in the Scala programming language continues to grow for many reasons. Scala embraces the functional programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm, and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java. Because Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and is interoperable with familiar Java frameworks. Scala also makes it easier to leverage the full power of concurrency.
Written for experienced Java, C++, or C# programmers who are new to Scala or functional programming, Scala for the Impatient, Second Edition, introduces the key Scala concepts and techniques you need in order to be productive quickly. It is the perfect introduction to the language, particularly for impatient readers who want to learn the fundamentals of Scala so they can start coding quickly. It doesn’t attempt to exhaustively list all the features of the language or make you suffer through long and contrived examples. Instead, carefully crafted examples and hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert.
This revised edition has been thoroughly updated for Scala 2.12 and reflects current Scala usage. It includes added coverage of recent Scala features, including string interpolation, dynamic invocation, implicit classes, and futures. Scala is a big language, but you can use it effectively without knowing all of its details intimately. This title provides precisely the information that you need to get started in compact, easy-to-understand chunks.

All the sub-tasks are combined together once the required results are achieved; they are then merged to get the final output. The whole process is very complex. This process goes from the design of concurrent algorithms to the testing phase where concurrent applications need extra attention. Java includes a comprehensive API with a lot of ready-to-use components to implement powerful concurrency applications in an easy way, but with a high flexibility to adapt these components to your needs.
The book starts with a full description of design principles of concurrent applications and how to parallelize a sequential algorithm. We’ll show you how to use all the components of the Java Concurrency API from basics to the most advanced techniques to implement them in powerful concurrency applications in Java.
You will be using real-world examples of complex algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, image processing in client / server environments. Next, you will learn how to use the most important components of the Java 8 Concurrency API: the Executor framework to execute multiple tasks in your applications, the phaser class to implement concurrent tasks divided into phases, and the Fork/Join framework to implement concurrent tasks that can be split into smaller problems (using the divide and conquer technique). Toward the end, we will cover the new inclusions in Java 8 API, the Map and Reduce model, and the Map and Collect model. The book will also teach you about the data structures and synchronization utilities to avoid data-race conditions and other critical problems. Finally, the book ends with a detailed description of the tools and techniques that you can use to test a Java concurrent application.

PHP has a rich history and a dominant place on the web. It has achieved much despite language inconsistencies and difficulties. Bjarne Stroustrup once said: “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses”.
PHP is one of those languages that everybody uses, yet that’s often seen as a good reason to ignore the bad parts and just get stuff done. We’re all for getting stuff done, and to that end, the author has used Plain Ol’ PHP for many years. It’s always bugged him how procedural PHP is, in an ecosystem of OOP libraries and frameworks.

There is also an explosion in popularity of JavaScript frameworks for client side development, and the authors cover two of the most popular UI frameworks. Start with TypeScript for developing clean JavaScript, along with a client side build tool such as Gulp, Grunt, and WebPack. Using the same data access layer and RESTful service from the .NET Core application, you can rebuild the UI using Angular 2.

Design patterns capture higher-level constructs that commonly appear in programs. If you know how to implement the design pattern in one language, typically you will be able to port and use it in another object-oriented programming language.
The choice of implementation language affects the use of design patterns. Naturally, some languages are more applicable for certain tasks than others. Each language has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. In this book, we introduce some of the better known design patterns in Python. You will learn when and how to use the design patterns, and implement a real-world example which you can run and examine by yourself.
You will start with one of the most popular software architecture patterns which is the Model- View-Controller pattern. Then you will move on to learn about two creational design patterns which are Singleton and Factory, and two structural patterns which are Facade and Proxy. Finally, the book also explains three behavioural patterns which are Command, Observer, and Template.

Right from the start your skills will be pushed as we introduce you to the power of Sass, the CSS preprocessor, to increase the speed of writing repetitive CSS tasks. We’ll then use simple but meaningful HTML examples, and add ARIA roles to increase accessibility. We’ll also cover when desktop-first or mobile-first approaches are ideal, and strategies to implement a mobile-first approach in your HTML builds.
After this we will learn how to use an easily scalable CSS grid or, if you prefer, how to use Flexbox instead. We also cover how to implement images and video in both responsive and responsible ways. Finally, we build a solid and elegant typographic scale, and make sure your messages and communications display correctly with responsive emails.

On top of that we live in a very mobile-centric world with the rise of Android smart phones and tablet devices and the surge in demand for the Android platform. Along with the demand for more data, there is a demand for efficient, “snappy” applications, and so developers need to have a strong understanding of when different data storage methods are appropriate and when they are not. Mastering how to use these two fields to successfully create a powerful application will help you boost your knowledge and skills in this area. “Android Database Programming” is designed to help developers create and design data-centric mobile applications on Google’s Android platform. As the world goes increasingly mobile and as consumers’ demand for data-centric applications rises, knowing how to combine the two effectively will become an increasingly important asset to have as a developer. The book starts by looking at the various local data storage methods on Android, and finishes off by examining external databases and ways you can utilize them from within an Android application. This book starts by looking at local data storage methods, focusing on writing SQLite databases for your application and also looking at ways to bind these databases to the user interface. The book, through its practical approach, strives to teach you by examples. Each chapter focuses on flushing out high level design concepts, before drilling down into different code examples. As you continue you will look at external databases

The JVM is now firmly established as a polyglot development environment with many projects opting for alternative development languages to Java such as Groovy, Scala, Clojure, and JRuby. In this pantheon of development languages, Groovy stands out for its excellent DSL enabling features which allows it to be manipulated to produce mini languages that are tailored to a project’s needs.
A comprehensive tutorial on designing and developing mini Groovy based Domain Specific Languages, this book will guide you through the development of several mini DSLs that will help you gain all the skills needed to develop your own Groovy based DSLs with confidence and ease.
Starting with the bare basics, this book will focus on how Groovy can be used to construct domain specific mini languages, and will go through the more complex meta-programming features of Groovy, including using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Practical examples are used throughout this book to de-mystify these seemingly complex language features and to show how they can be used to create simple and elegant DSLs. Packed with examples, including several fully worked DSLs, this book will serve as a springboard for developing your own DSLs.
Who This Book Is For
This book is for Java software developers who have an interest in building domain scripting into their Java applications. No knowledge of Groovy is required, although it will be helpful. This book does not teach Groovy, but quickly introduces the basic ideas of Groovy. An experienced Java developer should have no problems with these and move quickly on to the more involved aspects of creating DSLs with Groovy. No experience of creating a DSL is required.

For the mobile developer, that means learning three different languages to create the same application. Even if you use the Xamarin toolchain, you still need to work with three different user interface construction sets. Xamarin is essentially a container in which developers can write any application in C# and use the Xamarin compiler to package and deploy on Android, iOS, or Windows platforms. To top this, Xamarin.Forms plays the role of a single codebase for mobile applications.
This book will show you, with fully-coded examples, how to use both the Xamarin toolchain and the Xamarin.Forms library to code once for the three platforms. It goes from the concept and design of a mobile messenger application to its execution. You will be introduced to Messenger?the messaging app?which includes key features such as push notifications, UI, maps, databases, and web services. Next, you will learn to plan the UI using Xamarin.Forms for cross-mobile platform development, and move on to creating custom buttons, extending the UI, and connecting to social sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
You will also learn about the limitations of PCL libraries and how they make coding easier. This will be followed by the creation of a SQLite database and a database manager, and the SQLite database’s reflection within the database manager. You will then be taken through the use of hardware features with ample coverage of iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile. Finally, the book will conclude by introducing common strategies that allow you to create applications that “just work” without having to reinvent the wheel each time.

You will learn the very basics of the required core technologies and the setup needed to get going with Angular 2, and progressively enhance your understanding of Angular 2 components by working on the example application.
After reading the book and following the example application, you will have built a small-to-mid-sized application with Angular 2 using a component-based UI architecture.

It contains detailed explanations of the Core MVC functionality which enables developers to produce leaner, cloud optimized and mobile-ready applications for the .NET platform. This book puts ASP.NET Core MVC into context and dives deep into the tools and techniques required to build modern, cloud optimized extensible web applications. All the new MVC features are described in detail and the author explains how best to apply them to both new and existing projects.
The ASP.NET Core MVC Framework is the latest evolution of Microsoft’s ASP.NET web platform, built on a completely new foundation. It represents a fundamental change to how Microsoft constructs and deploys web frameworks and is free of the legacy of earlier technologies such as Web Forms. ASP.NET Core MVC provides a “host agnostic” framework and a high-productivity programming model that promotes cleaner code architecture, test-driven development, and powerful extensibility.
Best-selling author Adam Freeman has thoroughly revised this market-leading book and explains how to get the most from ASP.NET Core MVC. He starts with the nuts-and-bolts and shows you everything through to advanced features, going in-depth to give you the knowledge you need. The book includes a fully worked case study of a functioning web application that readers can use as a template for their own projects.

By using Capybara, you can develop robust tests quickly and run them in multiple drivers ensuring greater re-use; Capybara’s API also extends the human readable style made popular by frameworks such as Cucumber and RSpec.
“Application Testing with Capybara” takes you from installing the gem to getting up and running with a Google Search scenario within the first two chapters. We then look deeper into the API, using Rack-Test for applications built with Rails or Sinatra and see how to test handle Asynchronous JavaScript and “black box” components such as Flash. Finally, we consider some advanced topics such as looking at alternatives to Selenium and accessing the native driver directly.
This book takes you from the basics of installing Capybara, through its API and onto advanced topics. You will learn how to use Capybara’s extensive API to interact with your application, covering topics such as navigation, filling in forms, and querying your page for expected content. Beyond this we will consider why Capybara is so well suited to testing applications written in frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra. We will look at strategies for validating seemingly “untestable” components such as HTML5 or Flash by building out a testable API. Finally we will turn you into a Capybara ninja by covering advanced topics such as accessing functionality in the base driver, advanced driver configuration, and alternative flavours of drivers outside Selenium and Rack-Test.

These same apps must look fantastic whether running on a medium-resolution smartphone or high-resolution tablet. Fragments provide the toolset we need to meet these user expectations by enabling us to build our applications out of adaptable components that take advantage of the rich capabilities of each individual device and automatically adapt to their differences.
This book looks at the impact fragments have on Android UI design and their role in both simplifying many common UI challenges and in providing best practices for incorporating rich UI behaviors. We look closely at the roll of fragment transactions and how to work with the Android back stack. Leveraging this understanding, we explore several specialized fragment-related classes such as ListFragment and DialogFragment. We then go on to discuss how to implement rich navigation features such as swipe-based screen browsing, and the role of fragments when developing applications that take advantage of the latest aspects of Material Design.
You will learn everything you need to provide dynamic, multi-screen UIs within a single activity, and the rich UI features demanded by today’s mobile users.

It is an approach taken by developers to build applications and helps them add efficiency in their development process, thus making it more effective.
The book starts with the fundamentals of Modular Programming. Then we move on to the actual implementation, where we teach developers how to divide an application into different modules or layers (such as presentation, execution, security, lifecycle, services, and so on) for better management. Once readers are well-versed in these modules and their development, the book shows how to create bindings in order to join these different modules and form a complete application. Next, the readers will learn how to manage these modules through dependency injection.
Later, we move on to testing; readers will learn how to test the different modules of an application. The book ends by teaching readers how to maintain different versions of their application and how to modify it. By the end of the book, readers will have a good understanding of modular programming and will be able to use it to build applications with Java.

You will then look into multiple ways of storing domain entities in a database and learn important concepts such as transitive persistence, transactions and unit of work. This will be followed by retrieving data from database. Next, you will optimize your code, explore concepts such as the onion architecture, and learn where NHibernate fits best in an application’s architecture.

We’ll address many performance improvement techniques from both a general web standpoint and from a C#, ASP.NET Core, and .NET Core perspective. This includes delving into the latest frameworks and demonstrating software design patterns that improve performance.
We will highlight common performance pitfalls, which can often occur unnoticed on developer workstations, along with strategies to detect and resolve these issues early. By understanding and addressing challenges upfront, you can avoid nasty surprises when it comes to deployment time.
We will introduce performance improvements along with the trade-offs that they entail. We will strike a balance between premature optimization and inefficient code by taking a scientific- and evidence-based approach. We’ll remain pragmatic by focusing on the big problems.
By reading this book, you’ll learn what problems can occur when web applications are deployed at scale and know how to avoid or mitigate these issues. You’ll gain experience of how to write high-performance applications without having to learn about issues the hard way.
You’ll see what’s new in ASP.NET Core, why it’s been rebuilt from the ground up, and what this means for performance. You will understand how you can now develop on and deploy to Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux using cross-platform tools, such as Visual Studio Code.

SASS uses the power of Ruby to bring support for all three and more to your CSS, allowing you to engage in a more efficient, modular style of working, and making it easier to maintain your CSS styling in your projects.
Instant SASS CSS How-to is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear step-by-step exercises, which will help you take advantage of the power of SASS, and give you a good grounding in writing and compiling CSS style sheets using the SASS pre-processor language.
This book looks at how you can incorporate SASS into your web pages, and either produce style sheets dynamically, or pre-compile them before including the final article into your site’s pages.
You will also learn how you can use the power of mixins, functions, and variables to help produce style sheets, and reduce the amount of code you need to write in your style sheets. We will also take a look at how you can incorporate a more modular style to your development workflow, which will help with making style sheets more manageable and easier to update in the future. We will also take a look at how you can build up libraries of reusable code that you can incorporate into your future projects.
You will learn everything you need to know to start using SASS to help produce more efficient style sheets in your site’s pages, and adopt a more modular development workflow, which will make it easier to maintain your sites in the future.

Its applications are as broad and varied as mobile smartphone applications themselves. This book will educate you on the best practices and methodology needed to build effective, stable, and performant mobile VR applications.
In this book, we begin by defining virtual reality (VR) and how Google Cardboard fits into the larger VR and Android ecosystem. We introduce the underlying scientific and technical principles behind VR, including geometry, optics, rendering, and mobile software architecture. We start with a simple example app that ensures your environment is properly set up to write, build, and run the app. Then we develop a reusable VR graphics engine that you can build upon. And from then on, each chapter is a self-contained project where you will build an example from a different genre of application, including a 360 degree photo viewer, an educational simulation of our solar system, a 3D model viewer, and a music visualizer.
Given the recent updates that were rolled out at Google I/O 2016, the authors of Cardboard VR Projects for Android have collated some technical notes to help you execute the projects in this book with Google VR Cardboard Java SDK 0.8, released in May 2016. Refer to the article at https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/GoogleVRUpdateGuideforCardbook.pdf which explains the updates to the source code of the projects.
Who This Book Is For
The book is for established Android developers with a good knowledge level of Java. No prior OpenGL or graphics knowledge is required. No prior experience with Google Cardboard is expected, but those who are familiar with Cardboard and are looking for projects to expand their knowledge can also benefit from this book.

Definitely, if you are a .NET developer, knowing more about NHibernate will simplify and reduce your efforts in developing .Net applications.NHibernate 3 Beginner’s Guide introduces Nhibernate with step-by-step examples, and is the easiest way to learn about bridging the gap between object-oriented .NET applications and the relational database that stores the application’s data. It is a beginner’s guide to NHibernate that starts from scratch. Successive chapters build upon earlier concepts, while the sample code presents various ways to accomplish typical data access tasks.
NHibernate 3 Beginner’s Guide examines all of the topics required to get a functional data access layer implemented while writing the least amount of code possible, presenting options along the way to handle particular edge cases or situations as they arise. The book begins with an introduction to NHIbernate 3 and then moves on to creating the development environment. Then it teaches you how to create a model, define a database schema, and map the model to the database then covers sessions and transactions. This is succeeded by testing, profiling, and configuration, validation of data and writing queries. Finally, we wrap up with notes on the common pitfalls that you should avoid.
Once you complete reading the book, you will have gained the skills and knowledge to incorporate NHibernate into your own applications.

Alex Dymo will guide you through perils of memory and CPU optimization, profiling, measuring, performance testing, garbage collection, and tuning. You’ll find that all those “hard” things aren’t so difficult after all, and your code will run orders of magnitude faster.
This is the first book ever that consolidates all the Ruby performance optimization advice in one place. It’s your comprehensive guide to memory optimization, CPU optimization, garbage collector tuning, profiling, measurements, performance testing, and more.
You’ll go from performance rookie to expert. First, you’ll learn the best practices for writing Ruby code that’s easy not only on the CPU, but also on memory, and that doesn’t trigger the dreaded garbage collector. You’ll find out that garbage collection accounts for 80% of slowdowns, and often takes more than 50% of your program’s execution time. And you’ll discover the bottlenecks in Rails code and learn how selective attribute loading and preloading can mitigate the performance costs of ActiveRecord.
As you advance to Ruby performance expert, you’ll learn how profile your code, how to make sense out of profiler reports, and how to make optimization decisions based on them. You’ll make sure slow code doesn’t creep back into your Ruby application by writing performance tests, and you’ll learn the right way to benchmark Ruby.
And finally, you’ll dive into the Ruby interpreter internals to really understand why garbage collection makes Ruby so slow, and how you can tune it up.

Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, and scalability.
Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at JBoss Seam. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. The author presents an unbiased view of Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss, focusing on such topics as Spring integration and deployment to alternative application servers to steer clear of vendor lock-in. By the end of the book, you should expect to not only gain a deep understanding of Seam, but also come away with the confidence to teach the material to others.
To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations, solves the most common JSF pain points, and establishes the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. The author also shows you how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), Ajax remoting, PDF generation, asynchronous tasks, and more.
All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.

Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements. The popularity of the Spring framework is increasing and the security package of Spring addresses vast mechanisms of Security in a rich way. Due to an increasing number of applications for various business needs, the integration of multiple applications is becoming inevitable. The standard security procedures available across multiple implementations in Spring will protect vulnerable applications that are open to larger public and private audiences.
Spring Security Essentials focuses on the need to master the security layer, which is an area not often explored by a Spring developer.
At the beginning, we’ll introduce various industry standard security mechanisms and the practical ways to integrate with them. We will also teach you about some up-to-date use cases such as building a security layer for RESTful web services and applications.
The IDEs used and security servers involved are briefly explained, including the steps to install them. Many sample projects are also provided to help you practice your newly developed skills. Step-by-step instructions will help you master the security layer integration with the Server, then implement the experience gained from this book in your own real-time application.
Who This Book Is For
If you are a developer who is familiar with Spring and you are looking to explore its security features, then this book is for you. All beginners and experienced users will benefit from this book since it is explores both the theory and practical usage in detail.

Web developers can leverage their existing skills to write mobile applications in JavaScript that are truly native without using cross-compilation or web views. These applications have all of the advantages of those written in Objective-C or Java, combined with the rapid development cycle that JavaScript developers are accustomed to.
Web developers who want to develop native mobile applications face a high barrier to entry, because they are forced to learn platform-specific languages and frameworks. Numerous hybrid technologies have tried to simplify this process, but have failed to achieve the performance and appearance that users expect.
This book will show you all the advantages of true native development that React Native has without the steep learning curve, leveraging the knowledge you already have. We do this by getting you up and running quickly with a sample application. Next, we’ll introduce you to the fundamentals of creating components and explain how React Native works under the hood. Once you have established a solid foundation, you will dive headfirst into developing a real-world application from start to finish. Along the way, we will demonstrate how to create multiple screens and navigate between them,use layout and style native UI components, and access native APIs such as local storage and geolocation. Finally, we tackle the advanced topic of Native modules, which demonstrates that there are truly no limits to what you can do with React Native.

With the advent of HTML5 and CSS3, web design has become much simpler, and the new features that are now available help us design complex web pages with ease. These cool new features will be the standard for the future; hence, it is imperative to learn about them now.
HTML5 and CSS3 Transition, Transformation, and Animation will help you take advantage of the real power behind HTML5 and CSS3 and will give you a good grounding for using it in your own web pages. Each and every code sample and concept is explained in detail, and you will be provided with all the information you need to take your web pages to the next level – before all your competitors do!
The book starts by covering the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS3 such as semantics, Microdata, and the Flexbox model. You will then quickly progress to intermediate concepts such as form elements and some exciting features with JavaScript APIs. The code samples provided in this book will give you a solid base by which you will then be able to understand, write, and execute your own HTML/CSS projects with transition and animations.
Instead of wading through loads of theory, the concepts in this book are explained in a practical manner using code samples to demonstrate the new features of HTML5 and CSS3. The code samples are such that you can copy the code (the entire code is written instead of code snippets) and execute it for better understanding. Transition, transformation, and animation are also explained in a lucid manner, and there is a gradual increase in the difficulty level throughout the book.
By the end of the book, you will be thoroughly acquainted with HTML5 and CSS3, enabling you to design a web page using the included code samples with ease.

Hillar,2016,332,English,11.4 MB,PDF,Swift,,"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects; these are data structures that contain data in the form of fields, often known as attributes and code. Objects are everywhere, and so it is very important to recognize elements, known as objects, from real-world situations and know how they can easily be translated into object-oriented code.
Object-Oriented Programming with Swift is an easy-to-follow guide packed full of hands-on examples of solutions to common problems encountered with object-oriented code in Swift. It starts by helping you to recognize objects using real-life scenarios and demonstrates how working with them makes it simpler to write code that is easy to understand and reuse.
You will learn to protect and hide data with the data encapsulation features of Swift. Then, you will explore how to maximize code reuse by writing code capable of working with objects of different types. After that, you’ll discover the power of parametric polymorphism and will combine generic code with inheritance and multiple inheritance. Later, you move on to refactoring your existing code and organizing your source for easy maintenance and extensions.
By the end of the book, you will be able to create better, stronger, and more reusable code, which will help you build better applications.

With directives, you can take greater control over HTML elements on your web pages – they ‘direct’ Angular’s HTML compiler to behave in the way you want it to. It makes building modern web applications a much more expressive experience, and allows you to focus more closely on improving the way that user interaction impacts the DOM and the way your app manages data. If you’re already using Angular, you probably recognize the power of directives to transform the way you understand and build your projects – but customizing and creating your own directives to harness AngularJS to its full potential can be more challenging. This cookbook shows you how to do just that – it’s a valuable resource that demonstrates how to use directives at every stage in the workflow.
Packed with an extensive range of solutions and tips that AngularJS developers shouldn’t do without, you’ll find out how to make the most of directives. You’ll find recipes demonstrating how to build a number of different user interface components with directives, so you can take complete control over how users interact with your application. You’ll also learn how directives can simplify the way you work by creating reusable directives – by customizing them with Yeoman you can be confident that you’re application has the robust architecture that forms the bedrock of the best user experiences. You’ll also find recipes that will help you learn how to unit test directives, so you can be confident in the reliability and performance of your application.
Whether you’re looking for guidance to dive deeper into AngularJS directives, or you want a reliable resource, relevant to today’s web development challenges, AngularJS Directives Cookbook delivers everything you need in an easily accessible way.

It also exports these games to be compiled for any platform (from Windows to Mac to iOS to Android and Blackberry) all using the same graphic user interface.
Using an example as a tutorial, we will relate the driving principles and you’ll see how you can implement these principles to develop any games on the platform. We begin by setting expectations and providing a brief overview of the software. But it’s not long before you “dive in” to creating your first video game. You will actually have a playable level (“world”) by the end of the second chapter.
Later on, you’ll learn everything from basic graphics creation to advanced world design while you refine your first game, called “Ramblin’ Rover.” All along the way, you will see how certain functions could be used in tandem to create other types of games; hoping to spark imagination. We will follow the principles and process of monetization through ads and in-game rewards.
Lastly, we will go through the process of exporting, compiling, and preparing your storefront to sell the games you will eventually create.

TypeScript is ‘JavaScript for Application-scale development’; a superset of JavaScript that brings to it an additional object-oriented-like syntax familiar to .NET programmers that compiles down into simple, clean JavaScript that any browser can run today. It’s also tied to the next version of the JavaScript standard, which means that TypeScript will continue to evolve over time to keep in step with that standard and with the capabilities of the engines that will execute JavaScript applications.

It has expressive features familiar to those used to work with modern functional languages, while also keeping the object-oriented features of Objective-C. It remains compatible with Apple’s legacy codes and frameworks. A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples. Knowledge about design patterns is also one of the best ways to make you different compared to other low-level developers.
This book shows you how to use Swift 2 to learn about 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, and is organized into three categories. The book will present you the five creational patterns, followed by the seven structural patterns, and finishing with the 11 behavioral patterns as defined by the GoF. Each chapter will introduce the pattern by defining its role, which common problems the pattern should be used for, its generic UML representation, how each objects presented in the class diagram participate in the pattern, and what the role of each of these objects is. The book then presents you with a concrete case as an illustration that will be used to implement the pattern using Swift.

The ability to asynchronously fetch data and load scripts in the browser broadens the capabilities of JavaScript applications. But if you don’t understand how the async part works, you’ll wind up with unpredictable code that’s difficult to maintain. This book is ideal whether you’re new to Promises or want to expand your knowledge of this technology.
Understand how async JavaScript works by delving into callbacks, the event loop, and threading Learn how Promises organize callbacks into discrete steps that are easier to read and maintain Examine scenarios you’ll encounter and techniques you can use when writing real-world applications Use features in the Bluebird library and jQuery to work with Promises Learn how the Promise API handles asynchronous errors Explore ECMAScript 6 language features that simplify Promise-related code

AngularJS Directives serves as an in-depth study of some of the core features of AngularJS and provides you with all the knowledge you need to create fully dynamic web applications that respond in real-time to changes in data. You’ll learn how to build directives from the ground up as well as some of the best practices for architecting them. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to create a web application comprised of multiple modules all working together seamlessly to provide the best possible user experience.
AngularJS Directives starts by investigating the best practices for single-page application development overall before diving into how AngularJS directives fulfill those goals. At each step, you’ll learn both the how and why of what we’re building, and by the end, you’ll not only know the facts necessary to create a directive, but you’ll also have the knowledge to decide how best to assemble it.
You’ll also learn why it’s best to build applications with the data-model as your foundation, how to craft new dynamic modules that communicate with each other, how to build widgets that can be embedded in third-party websites, and even how to create custom inputs so your users can intuitively interact with your data. In AngularJS Directives, you’ll learn all the necessary tools to begin architecting your own directives and how to use them in the construction of a more dynamic Web.

As the name suggests, microservicess refers to small services. For a large implementation, this means breaking the system into really small, independent services. Alternative to monolithic architecture (where the entire system is considered as a single big, interwoven segment), microservices approach is getting more and more popular with large, complex applications that have a very long lifecycle, which require changes at regular intervals. Microservices approach allows this type of changes with ease as only a part of the system undergoes changes and change control is easy.
An example of such large system can be an online store?includes user interface, managing product catalog, processing orders, managing customer’s account. In a microservices architecture each of these tasks will be divided and into smaller services. Also, these services will be further broken down into independent services?for user interface, there will be separate services for input, output, search bar management, and so on. Similarly, all other tasks can be divided in very small and simple services.
What you will learn
Identify where the microservice oriented architectures can tackle the most common problems in the software used by the big organisations. Re-architecture an existing monolithic system into a microservices oriented software. Build robust and scalable microservices using Seneca and Node.js. Testing of the microservices in insolation in order to create a solid system.

This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you’ll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices. Of course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you’re up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you’ll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.
An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You’ll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you’ll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages.
Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We’ll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You’ll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser.
JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You’ll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture.
While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle.
Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript provides invaluable information applicable to every web project?regardless of size, scope, or budget.

In this second edition, you will find updated coverage of the Scala 2.12 platform. The Scala 2.12 series targets Java 8 and requires it for execution. The book starts by introducing you to the foundations of concurrent programming on the JVM, outlining the basics of the Java Memory Model, and then shows some of the classic building blocks of concurrency, such as the atomic variables, thread pools, and concurrent data structures, along with the caveats of traditional concurrency.
The book then walks you through different high-level concurrency abstractions, each tailored toward a specific class of programming tasks, while touching on the latest advancements of async programming capabilities of Scala. It also covers some useful patterns and idioms to use with the techniques described. Finally, the book presents an overview of when to use which concurrency library and demonstrates how they all work together, and then presents new exciting approaches to building concurrent and distributed systems.

It also examines how we can facilitate the reuse of design practices in the development lifecycle of multi-devices, multi-platforms and multi-contexts user interfaces.
Effective design tools are provided for combining HCI design patterns and User Interface (UI) driven engineering to enhance design whilst differentiating between UI and the underlying system features. Several examples are used to demonstrate how HCI design patterns can support this decoupling by providing an architectural framework for pattern-oriented and model-driven engineering of multi-platforms and multi-devices user interfaces.
Patterns of HCI Design and HCI Design of Patterns is for students, academics and Industry specialists who are concerned with user interfaces and usability within the software development community.

It is easy to install and use, even on personal systems. It is evolving and expanding to meet the database needs of today, tomorrow, and into the future. MariaDB is a drop in replacement for MySQL it also has a lot of new features and performance enhancements that differentiate it from MySQL. It is also powerful enough to be the database of choice for some of the biggest and most popular websites in the world.
This practical guide unlocks the advanced features of MariaDB’s capabilities, including new storage engines, performance enhancing optimizations, and other advanced abilities. If you’re looking to backend your enterprise, cloud, or embedded or mobile apps with a fast, free, open source, and familiar SQL database, MariaDB is perfect for you.
We begin with installing MariaDB and configuring it to unlock powerful optimizations that can speed up certain queries exponentially. We will then move on to using the extra storage engines included with MariaDB, such as TokuDB and the CONNECT engine. With those mastered, it’s then time to branch out from single to multi-server installations, so we will dive into MariaDB’s clustering and replication features, learning how to efficiently search and index our data, work with NoSQL-style data, and connect MariaDB with a Cassandra cluster. It’s a dangerous world out there, so last of all, we wrap things up with recipes on securing MariaDB.
This is your ideal guide for getting the most out of MariaDB.

In Eloquent Ruby,Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do–so you can leverage its immense, surprising power.
Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness.
Eloquent Rubystarts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You’ll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for.
Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You’ll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code–and why you’ll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages.
A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, Eloquent Rubywill help you “put on your Ruby-colored glasses” and get results that make you a true believer.

Being part of the Spring Framework, it naturally extended and supported it with an amazing set of recognizable annotations. External libraries can be plugged in and plugged out. It also possesses a request flow.
Complete support of REST web services makes the Spring architecture an extremely consistent choice to support your front-end needs and Internet transformations.
From the design of your Maven modules, you will achieve an Enterprise-standard for a stateless REST application based on Spring and Spring MVC with this book.
This guide is unique in its style as it features a massive overview of practical development techniques brought together from the Spring ecosystem, the new JEE standards, the JavaScript revolution and Internet of Things.
You will begin with the very first steps of Spring MVC’s product design. Focused on deployment, viability, and maintainability, you will learn the use of Eclipse, Maven, and Git. You will walk through the separation of concerns driven by the microservices principles. Using Bootstrap and AngularJS, you will develop a responsive front-end, capable of interacting autonomously with a REST API.
Later in the book, you will setup the Java Persistence API (JPA) within Spring; learn how to configure your Entities to reflect your domain needs, and discover Spring Data repositories. You will analyze how Spring MVC responds to complex HTTP requests. You will implement Hypermedia and HATEOAS to guide your customer’s stateless conversation with the product and see how a messaging-service based on WebSocket can be configured. Finally you will learn how to set up and organize different levels of automated-tests, including logging and monitoring.

This in-depth tutorial goes beyond what is available anywhere else to teach how to write WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to handle events and asynchronous method calls.
Reactive programming allows you to turn those aspects of your code that are currently imperative into something much more event-driven and flexible. For this reason, it’s sometimes referred to as LINQ for Events.
Reactive programming hinges on the concept of the observable collection, as opposed to the simple enumerable collection with which we’re all familiar. For example, to extract data from a collection and add it to a list box, you would traditionally iterate through the list box, extracting each object in turn. This approach works fine, but it requires significant knowledge about the data you’re working with, which can be limiting. In Rx programming, you’re instead informed about each object in turn and then free to react to each notification however you like, which affords much greater flexibility.
This book shows you how reactive programming can be applied to a range of situations—from WPF applications to Windows Phone apps—to improve coding efficiency and boost performance.

This book, and the framework it covers, is the perfect solution to your needs. Ruby on Rails provides an easy-to-use method for quickly developing web applications, simplifying potentially complicated subjects such as web architecture, JavaScript, and SQL/database creation. The simplicity of Rails belies its power, though—this technology is used by major companies such as 37Signals and Google.
The book provides an introduction to Ruby on Rails with the web designer in mind. Instead of focusing on the intricate syntax of each method, the book focuses on the tasks youll want to perform on your website and then walks you through how to implement that functionality with Rails. Design and usability are kept in mind throughout, ensuring that your site both looks and works great.
The book begins by covering how to set up your computer as a Rails development environment (including the MySQL database) and then follows with an introduction to Ruby and the basics of the Rails framework. Next, you are taken through several practical examples that work together to build up a complete modern web application, covering essential and useful website features such as user login, adding and editing data, data validation, image uploading, and much more. The book even covers more-advanced Rails topics such as the Rails test suite, plug-ins and components, debugging techniques, and deploying your web applications using Capistrano.

With Symfony, you can turn your code into a service and reuse it in other projects.
This book starts with Symfony concepts such as bundles, routing, twig, doctrine, and more, taking you through the request/response life cycle. You will then proceed to set up development, test, and deployment environments in AWS. Then you will create reliable projects using Behat and Mink, and design business logic, cover authentication, and authorization steps in a security checking process. You will be walked through concepts such as DependencyInjection, service containers, and services, and go through steps to create customized commands for Symfony’s console.

One of the important aspects of this book is a focus on new and modern abstractions provided by Spring. Therefore most of the features are shown with Java annotations alongside established XML configurations. Most of the examples in the book are also based on the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot adoption is exponential because of its capability to significantly simplify Spring configuration using sensible opinionated defaults. But Spring Boot is not the target of the exam, therefore all the features are also covered with plain Spring configuration examples.

Kali Linux is the premier platform for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS.
This book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali’s top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system’s DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important.
Thus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege’s escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network.
Who This Book Is For
If you are a working ethical hacker who is looking to expand the offensive skillset with a thorough understanding of Kali Linux, then this is the book for you. Prior knowledge about Linux operating systems and the BASH terminal emulator along with Windows desktop and command line would be highly beneficial.

However, orchestrating multiple clients and keeping everyone in sync with a game server, reducing and managing network latency (all the while preventing cheating), and making sure every player has an excellent experience can quickly become overwhelming.
This book will teach you how to develop games that support multiple players interacting in the same game world, and show you how to perform network programming operations in order to implement such systems. It covers the fundamentals of game networking by developing a real-time multiplayer game of Tic-tac-toe before moving on to convert an existing 2D single-player snake game to multiplayer, using a more scalable game design for online gaming.
Finally you will be tackling more advanced networking topics, allowing you to handle problems such as server queries from multiple users and making your multiplayer games more secure and less prone to cheating.

While there are a few online resources that explain what crowdsourced testing is all about, there’s been a need for a book that covers best practices, case studies, and the future of this technique.
Filling this need, Leveraging the Wisdom of the Crowd in Software Testing shows you how to leverage the wisdom of the crowd in your software testing process. Its comprehensive coverage includes the history of crowdsourcing and crowdsourced testing, implementation practices, and future trends.
The book discusses best practices in implementation—explaining what, when, and how to crowdsource in a testing effort. It also includes case studies that illustrate how both product and service companies have successfully applied crowdsourcing in their testing programs.
Explaining how to use the combined advantages of crowdsourcing and cloud computing for software testing, the book examines various engagement models in which you could implement crowdsourced testing. It addresses effective defect management in crowdsourced testing and considers both the business and engineering aspects of crowdsourced testing.
The book explores the challenges, limitations, and situations when crowdsourced testing will not work and provides powerful best practices for mitigating the constraints and challenges, including how to build a crowdsourcing platform to test software products. Covering career opportunities for crowd testers, the book concludes by taking a look at the need to build a crowdsourced testing ecosystem, who the players of such an ecosystem would be, and who would need to champion such an effort.

Anyone working with applications that use a MySQL database backend will benefit greatly from the advice and techniques in this book. Although a working knowledge of both SQL and MySQL is assumed, the book is suitable for both beginners and intermediate users alike. Whether you read it through and absorb the advice or work through it on a live project, the efficiency and maintainability of your databases will certainly improve as a result.
